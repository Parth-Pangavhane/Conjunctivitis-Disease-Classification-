# Conjunctivitis-Disease-Classification-

This repository contains a deep learning project focused on classifying conjunctivitis disease using neural networks. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable system for automated diagnosis of conjunctivitis, which can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and treatment.

# Introduction
Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is a common eye condition characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva. Early diagnosis is crucial for timely treatment and to prevent the spread of infection. This project aims to build a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying conjunctivitis from images.
